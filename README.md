 Hello! My name is Sabrina and I‘m a 16 year old self-taught Front-End Developer based in NRW Germany. My interest in web development started back in 2017, I tried to develop a website out of curiosity after seeing my brother doing it.

Ever since, I’ve been loving it.

When I’m not doing anything coding related, I’m a high schooler who enjoys graphic designing, video editing and working out.
